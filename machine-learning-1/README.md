# Machine Learning Study

Author: Elena Fuchs 
Program: MSc Data Science  

This repository contains structured study material for Machine Learning 1.

The focus is on:

- Linear models
- Statistical inference
- Hypothesis testing
- Bias–variance decomposition
- Mathematical derivations
- Clean Python implementations

The goal is to deeply understand the foundations of machine learning before moving into more complex models.
